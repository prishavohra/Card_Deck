This is a Java program that simulates a deck of playing cards. It allows users to perform various operations, such as printing the deck, shuffling, finding specific cards, dealing cards, and comparing them. Following are its features:
-> Create a deck of 52 playing cards
-> Print all cards in the deck
-> Display a specific card
-> Check if two cards have the same suit
->Compare two cards by rank
-> Find a specific card
-> Shuffle the deck
-> Deal 5 random cards
